Generated: 2025-11-19T09:26:05.480502 UTC

Features included:
- Next.js App Router structure
- Tailwind CSS (basic setup)
- Framer Motion animations for UI polish
- Zustand for simple client state (cart, wishlist, search query)
- Dark mode toggle (persisted in localStorage)
- Search, client-side filter, wishlist, cart, reviews (dummy)
- API route: /api/books (GET)
- 5 mock books with placeholder images

How to run:
1. Extract ZIP
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`
4. Visit http://localhost:3000

Notes & next steps:
- This is a demo-quality starter, not a production-ready e-commerce.
- For production: integrate real auth, payment gateway, database, and security hardening.
- If you want, I can now add: server-side rendering for catalog, pagination, better image optimization, or integrate a real backend (Node + PostgreSQL).

Enjoy — say what you want improved next!
